I implemented my sender and receiver by dividing them up into several pieces. I do all the initialization in the sender and receiver class, and I added logs to debug. Then I expand on the starter code to fulfill the send-and-receive functionalities. Then I make sure the acknowledgment handling correctly handles ack between the programs to communicate packet status. If packets are sent successfully, my receiver prints out the received packets in order. 
Calculating the checksum was a challenge for me, I have to make the calculation consistan between the sender and the receiver. Debugging was also a challenge, I have to create tests for my methods and create some psudo data to run to verify the behaviors of the sender and receiver. 
Overall, I put some of the methods into another local file and wrote tests to verify the bahavior,such as checksum and aknoledgement handling. Another part that was challenging was to understand what the error messages mean in the provided tets. They are very long and I have to dive into it to find out what is wrong.
