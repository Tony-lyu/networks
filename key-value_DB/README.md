I first read the project description and did some reasearch on Raft algorithms to make sure I know what I'm doing. Then I wrote the get and put methods to start the program running. After that, I implemented the election protocol. After they are working, I spend most of my time experimenting with the AppendEntries RPC call. 
The first challenge is to get the election protocol right, I had to revisit the lectures to fully understand the expected behaviors of the election protocol. Another challenge is to ensuring the consistency in log replication across the nodes, and this is the part I spend the most time on debugging.
To test my code, I started by running the provided test and then debug the failed tests by writing custom tests. I created my own json to test the behavior of my code.
