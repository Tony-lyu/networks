My guessing process involves 2 rounds, in the first round, I generate a list of words from the wordlist that contains all letters(and I try to make the list as small as possible, usually the list contains 6-7 words). Then, I send the words in this list one by one to the server and record the marks, so now I would know which 5 letters are in the secret word, and if I'm lucky, I would know some letters in the correct position. Then I move on to my second-round guess. I go through the initial wordlist again to factor out words that are not possible by applying my current knowledge of the word that I found during the first round of guessing. Usually, I will end up with a list that is fewer than 5 words. Finally, I would send these words to the server one by one again until I got the correct secret word. 

This algorithm turns out to take very few guesses(since I had the pressure of a guess limit when I started), but it does cost extra time. I loop through the initial wordlist several times and some of them are nested loops, so the algorithm has a big O of O(5n^2) which is not super efficient(I got the 5 because all words are 5 letters long).
